# Std_proc_Final
This is a project our team made at the VCET Hackathon 2019. This is a student proctor project. The project is like a virtual mentor to students,
guiding them to achieve overall excellence, both in academics and in extracurriculars.
The project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for the frontend,
Python (Django) as the Backend Framework,
Libraries of Python like Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, for the logic in Data Analysis and Machine Learning,
PostgreSQL for the database.
The project is yet to be deployed on a website. It requires a few modifications, on which the team will work later.
Details of code will be provided soon.
